Slash Mark Internship :

Advance project - Forest Fire detection using CNN.

I used Yolov7 as it is a state-of-art model.
The data set I used is from 'roboflow' : https://universe.roboflow.com/mon-qcmwp/fire-amoke/dataset/1#

The colab link where I trained the model : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UvmnenX6jFKoKSWTtCAey1fPMQf0tnbI?usp=sharing

The model which is in .pt format is huge in size and GitHub limited the uplaod to below 25MB, So model was not uploaded. Yet you can run the code that is in my Colab and get the model.
